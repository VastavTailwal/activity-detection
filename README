# Human Activity Detection Using IMU Sensor Data

This project provides a dataset and framework for Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using motion data collected from an **ESP32-S3** device equipped with an **Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU)** sensor. The dataset captures seven different physical activities and is suitable for machine learning applications in areas such as activity tracking, rehabilitation monitoring, and smart environments.
